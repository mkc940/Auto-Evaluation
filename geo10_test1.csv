Explain the land use pattern in India and why has the land under forest not increased much since 1960-61?,"The use of land is determined both by physical factors such as topography, climate, soil types as well as human factors such as population density, technological capability and culture and traditions etc. The pattern of the net sown area varies greatly from one state to another. It is over 80 per cent of the total area in Punjab and Haryana and less than 10 per cent in Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Manipur and Andaman Nicobar Islands. Forest area in the country is far lower than the desired 33 per cent of geographical area, as it was outlined in the National Forest Policy (1952). It was considered essential for the maintenance of the ecological balance. A part of the land is termed as wasteland and land put to other non-agricultural uses. Wasteland includes rocky, arid and desert areas and land put to other non-agricultural uses includes settlements, roads, railways, industry etc. Continuous use of land over a long period of time without taking appropriate measures to conserve and manage it has resulted in land degradation.","Land resources in India are primarily divided into agricultural land, forest land, pasture and grazing land, and wasteland. Wasteland includes rocky, arid and desert areas and land used for non-agricultural purposes like housing, roads, industry, etc.
According to recent data available, the percentage of net sown area (NSA) in India is about 54% of the total reporting area (if, the other than current fallow lands is included). . 22.5% is covered by forests, and 3.45% is used for grazing. The rest is a wasteland, with traces of miscellaneous cultivation.
Improper use of forest land has led to land degradation and made conservation of forests difficult. Human activities like deforestation, overgrazing, mining, quarrying, etc have contributed to the slow growth rate of forests. Thus, land under forest has increased by only about 4% since 1960-61.","In India, the land is primarily used for agriculture, grazing and other activities like housing, construction of roads and industries. Some part of it is covered with forests and deserts. The pattern of the net sown area varies from one state to another state depending upon the climate and soil types. For example, about 80 percent of the total area in Punjab and Haryana is used for cultivation while in Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Manipur and Andaman Nicobar Islands, it is even less than 10 percent. The part of the land which is covered by forests in India is about 22%.
The land under the forest has not increased since 1960–61 due to the increased use of land for agricultural activities, industrialisation and urbanisation. Increasing population and subsequent increase in demand for resources resulted in the degradation of forests. The land under forest has increased by only about 4% since 1960-61.","Land resources in India are primarily divided into agricultural land, forest land, land meant for pasture and grazing, and waste land. Waste land includes rocky, arid and desert areas, and land used for other non-agricultural purposes such as housing, roads and industry. According to the recent data, about 54% of the total land area is cultivable or fallow, 22.78% is covered by forests, and 3.38% is used for grazing. The rest is waste land, with traces of miscellaneous cultivation. The land under forest has not increased since 1960–61 because in the post-independence era demand for more land to expand agriculture, mainly after Green Revolution, developmental works and infrastructural facilities, led to clearance of forests areas. Industrialisation and urbanisation also decreased the forest area. Thus, land under forest has increased by only about 4% since 1960-61.","The land is a resource that is the most important for the survival of human beings. Land use pattern is the arrangement for the uses of land for different purposes. The most important types of land use patterns in India are Forests area, Land not available for cultivation, Cultivable wastelands, Fallow land, Net area sown. The usage of land depends on two factors: Humans and physical.
- Physical factors: It depends on the nature of lands, such as topographies, climate, and soil types.
- Human factors: It relies on human activities and usage such as population density, culture and traditions, and technological capability.
The land under the forest has not increased since 1960-61 because the demand for land has increased for agriculture and industrialization. The Green Revolution led to the expansion of agriculture and led to clearances of the forests. As of present, only 21.67% of land area in India is covered by forests, which should be ideally 33%. Industrialization and urbanization have also led to  a decrease in the forest area. As the population is increasing the need for houses is also increasing which is leading to deforestation and decreasing the forest cover of the country. Almost 54% of the area of India is now available for cultivation, out of which 25% is wasteland and 3% is grassland. The other land is used for urban developments. Hence, because of all these factors, the land under forest has not increased much since 1960-61.  ","The land is a resource that is the most important for the survival of human beings.

According to recent data ","Lakshadweep Islands: Lakshadweep group of islands is composed of small coral islands. Earlier they were known as Laccadive, Minicoy and Amindive. In 1973, these were named as Lakshadweep. It covers a small area of 32 sq km. Kavaratti Island is the administrative headquarters of Lakshadweep. This island group has a great diversity of flora and fauna. The Pitti island, which is uninhabited, has a bird sanctuary.Northern Plains are the most recent landforms. The northern plains are formed of alluvial deposits. The northern plain has been formed by the interplay of the three major river systems, namely — the Indus, the Ganga and the Brahmaputra along with their tributaries. This plain is formed of alluvial soil. The deposition of alluvium in a vast basin lying at the foothills of the Himalaya over millions of years formed this fertile plain. It spreads over an area of 7 lakh sq. km. The plain being about 2400 km long and 240 to 320 km broad, is a densely populated physiographic division. With a rich soil cover combined with an adequate water supply and favourable climate, it is agriculturally a productive part of India. "
How has technical and economic development led to more consumption of resources? ,"There are various reasons for this. 1. Large scale production led to over utilisation of resources. 2. Technological advancement led to greater exploitation of resources. 3. Improved medical and health resources led to huge consumption of resources. 4. Technological development and economic progress have led to populations increasing due to low mortality at all ages. With new developments in medicine and health care, fewer people die due to accidents, diseases, childbirth, etc. This too has contributed to higher consumption of resources. 5. Technological development led to efficient machinery.","The following factors have been responsible for technical and economic development leading to overconsumption of resources.
In colonial times, imperial powers used their technological and economic superiority to establish control over other countries and thereby gain access to the latter’s resources. One country’s resources were accessible to the citizens of its colonial ruler too, leading to increased consumption. Technical progress also results in inefficient machinery, increased production, and greater consumption of resources.

•	Technological development led to efficient machinery. As a result, production increased ultimately leading to the consumption of more resources.
•	Economic development raised people's demands and the technological advancement led to greater exploitation of resources to meet their demands.
•	Improved medical and health resources led to increased population which in turn resulted in increased consumption of resources.","Technical and economic development have led to more consumption of resources on account of various factors such as: 
 Technological development provides sophisticated equipments. As a result, production increases ultimately leading to consumption of more resources. 
Technological development also leads to economic development. When the economic condition of a country rises, the needs of people also rise. It again results into more consumption of resources. 

Economic development provides favourable environment for the development of latest technologies. It helps to make or convert various materials found around us into resources. Finally, it results into the consumption of new available resources too.
","In a globalizing world economy, the causes for the differences in economic development and inter-country income inequality is clarified on the grounds of technological differences. The goal of science and technology is to enable businesses and individuals to use technologies more efficiently, as this yields reduced costs and enriched productivity gains. Various developments have led to the overuse of resources and has undoubtedly affected it. Technical and economic development have steered the consumption of resources in the following ways;
-It renders equipment which increases output leads to the consumption of more resources.
-The economic growth leads to the rise of the necessities of people which results in the consumption of resources.
-Higher grade of technological development needs more and more resources for generation purposes.
-Economic development provides a strategy for the improvement of modern technologies and modifies different types of materials into resources.","The following factors have been responsible for technical and economic development leading to overconsumption of resources.

Describe how communities have conserved and protected forests and wildlife in India?,"Chipko Movement: The famous Chipko movement in the Himalayas has not only successfully resisted deforestation in several areas but has also shown that community afforestation with indigenous species can be enormously successful. Certain societies revere a particular tree which they have preserved from time immemorial. The Mundas and the Santhal of Chota Nagpur region worship mahua (Bassia latifolia) and kadamba (Anthocaphalus cadamba) trees, and the tribals of Odisha and Bihar worship the tamarind (Tamarindus indica) and mango (Mangifera indica) trees during weddings. To many of us, peepal and banyan trees are considered sacred. In Sariska Tiger Reserve, Rajasthan, villagers have fought against mining by citing the Wildlife Protection Act. In many areas, villagers themselves are protecting habitats and explicitly rejecting government involvement. The inhabitants of five villages in the Alwar district of Rajasthan have declared 1,200 hectares of forest as the Bhairodev Dakav ‘Sonchuri’, declaring their own set of rules and regulations which do not allow hunting and are protecting the wildlife against any outside encroachments.","In India many traditional communities still live in the forests and depend on their livelihood for forest produce. These communities are working hand in hand with the government to conserve forests.
In Sariska Tiger Reserve, Rajasthan, villagers fought against mining activities. In Alwar district of Rajasthan, local communities belonging to five villages have set their own rules and regulations in 1,200 hectares of forest land. They have named it as the Bhairodev Dakav ‘Sonchuri’. Hunting is not allowed in these lands and outside encroachments are prohibited.
The famous Chipko movement was started in the Himalayan region to stop deforestation. People belonging to the local community took to afforestation in a big way. Indigenous species were cultivated and protected.
Involving local communities in protecting the environment, and stopping degradation of forests has reaped many benefits.","In India many traditional communities still live in a close contact with the forests as they depend on the forest produce for their livelihood. Such local communities are contributing significantly in conservation of the forest land. For example;

•	The Bishnois of Rajasthan protect black buck, chinkara and peacocks quite fervently.
•	Chipko movement is another example of community initiative that resisted deforestation in several areas.
Nature worship is an age old tradition for many local communities. By doing so, they help in conservation of forest. ","Indian forests are home to different communities. These communities have a complex relationship with their environment. The Mundas and the Santhal of Chhota Nagpur region worship Mahua and Kadamba trees; the tribals of Orissa and Bihar worship the tamarind and mango trees. Similarly, the Bishnois of Rajasthan hold the antelopes in high reverence. For these communities, particular flora and fauna are integral to their identity, so they take a number of steps to protect the same. Villagers around the Sariska Reserve have opposed mining activities in the region as these activities endanger wildlife. Villagers in the Alwar district of Rajasthan have banned hunting and lumbering activities in a 1200 hectare area they have marked as Bhairodev Dakav 'Sonchuri'. Such activities have helped preserve patches of virgin forest land.","Conservation protects the natural diversity of water, air, and soil and our life support systems. It also protects plant and animal genetic diversity for better species and breeding development. In 1972, the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act was passed, with various habitat protection provisions. A list of protected species was also released for all of India. The geographical condition of India and various climatic features have endowed the country with a large range of biological communities. Neither forest policy nor forest laws paid much respect to wildlife in the early years of forest conservation. The wildlife was 'game' and abundant. At the cost of community forests, the food crisis of the Second World War gave rise to an expansion of agriculture. Land allocation gained an extra social hue with independence-land for the landless-and even reserve forests were not spared. If it had not been for the activities of some ardent friends of wildlife, the scope of destruction would have been much greater.","In India many traditional communities still live in a close contact with the forests as they depend on the forest produce for their livelihood.

The woods which cannot be used and that need less time to grow must be used as raw materials. Selectively the trees are cut so that rare trees are preserved.
Forest fires are the primary source of deforestation. Proper measures to prevent forest fires should be taken. Old woods that can catch fire due to lightning must be removed. Steps to lower the forest fires should be considered. Planning and execution of the elimination of forest fires must be done priorly by the government. 
Various reforestation programs like the World Environment Day celebrated on June 5th of every year should be practiced by multiple schools and colleges. Youth must be encouraged to plant and look after the plants. The importance of conserving the trees must be explained to the people. 
The exploitation of forest products must be stopped. Strict rules and implementation of the regulations must be made on people who exploit forest wealth. Forest management departments should take care of the sustainable growth of the forests and ensure that hunting and poaching activities are avoided.


Wildlife Conservation
The protection of diverse wildlife in the forest is called wildlife conservation. Wildlife is the animals and birds that live in the woods and that are not domesticated by anyone. The wood is their natural habitat, and destruction of the forests leads these animals to become homeless. These animals can later come among the villages and feed on the crops as they do not have a specific home to live. 
Medicinal plants that have an essential therapeutic value are obtained in forests. Most of the antibiotics are manufactured by the raw materials found in the woods. Almost one-third of the pharmaceutical industry gets its raw materials from the woods. These medicinal plants may also have the potential to cure many diseases that man has not found a cure for. Hence, forests are essential places for scientists to find specimens to research and find a cure, explore different properties of plants. These medicinal plants are wild and can also come under the term of wildlife.
Forests and wildlife are necessary to regulate the population of different species of animals and birds. The forest ecosystem has primary, secondary, and tertiary consumers in the food chain. 
Forests help in maintaining biodiversity as various species of organisms takes shelter in the woods. Microorganisms that are necessary for the biosphere to survive, such as nitrogen-fixing bacteria, also take refuge in the soil of the forest. They regulate the nitrogen content of the earth and make it sustainable for living.

Discuss how rainwater harvesting in semi-arid regions of Rajasthan is carried out.,"In the semi-arid and arid regions of Rajasthan, particularly in Bikaner, Phalodi and Barmer, almost all the houses traditionally had underground tanks or tankas for storing drinking water. The tanks could be as large as a big room; one household in Phalodi had a tank that was 6.1 metres deep, 4.27 metres long and 2.44 metres wide. The tankas were part of the well-developed rooftop rainwater harvesting system and were built inside the main house or the courtyard. They were connected to the sloping roofs of the houses through a pipe. Rain falling on the rooftops would travel down the pipe and was stored in these underground ‘tankas’. The first spell of rain was usually not collected as this would clean the roofs and the pipes. The rainwater from the subsequent showers was then collected. The rainwater can be stored in the tankas till the next rainfall making it an extremely reliable source of drinking water when all other sources are dried up, particularly in the summers. Rainwater, or palar pani, as commonly referred to in these parts, is considered the purest form of natural water.","In the semi-arid and arid regions of Rajasthan, particularly in Bikaner, Phalodi and Barmer, almost all the houses traditionally had underground tanks or tankas for storing drinking water.

Rain water harvesting in semi-arid regions of Rajasthan is carried out in the following ways:
•	The people in Jaisalmer built 'khadins' to store rainwater. ‘Khadin’ is an embankment which prevents water from flowing away. Collected water then seeps into the soil. This water saturates land which is then used for growing crops.
•	Several step wells were constructed in Rajasthan for storing rainwater.
•	People in Rajasthan built underground tanks called tankas for storing water
•	Tankas were built inside houses or in the main courtyard. They were connected to the sloping roofs of the houses through a pipe. Rainwater falling on the rooftop, travelled down the pipe and were stored in these underground tankas.
•	 The rainwater collected, is stored within the tanks providing beverage till subsequent season .
•	 When all other sources have dried up, these tanks were beneficial to fight against the summer heat as they kept the rooms cool. The rainwater or palar pani, as commonly known in these parts, is taken into account the purest sort of natural water.
•	 Paar is a common water harvesting practice in the western Rajasthan region. It is a standard place where the rainwater flows from the agar and within the process percolates into the sandy soil. In order to access the rajani pani which is percolated water, kuis or beris are dug within the agor which is a storage area.","In the semi-arid and arid regions of Rajasthan, particularly in Bikaner, Phalodi and Barmer, almost all the houses traditionally had underground tanks or tankas for storing drinking water.

Describe how modern adaptations of traditional rainwater harvesting methods are being carried out to conserve and store water. ,"Water harvesting system is a viable alternative, both socio-economically and environmentally. In ancient India, along with the sophisticated hydraulic structures, there existed an extraordinary tradition of water-harvesting system. People had in-depth knowledge of rainfall regimes and soil types and developed wide-ranging techniques to harvest rainwater, groundwater, river water and floodwater in keeping with the local ecological conditions and their water needs. In hill and mountainous regions, people built diversion channels like the ‘guls’ or ‘kuls’ of the Western Himalayas for agriculture. ‘Rooftop rainwater harvesting’ was commonly practised to store drinking water, particularly in Rajasthan. In the flood plains of Bengal, people developed inundation channels to irrigate their fields. In arid and semi-arid regions, agricultural fields were converted into rain-fed storage structures that allowed the water to stand and moisten the soil like the ‘khadins’ in Jaisalmer and ‘Johads’ in other parts of Rajasthan.

Suggest the initiative taken by the government to ensure the increase in agricultural production. ,"The Government of India embarked upon introducing agricultural reforms to improve Indian agriculture in the 1960s and 1970s. The Green Revolution based on the use of package technology and the White Revolution (Operation Flood) were some of the strategies initiated to improve a lot of Indian agriculture. But, this too led to the concentration of development in a few selected areas. Therefore, in the 1980s and 1990s, a comprehensive land development programme was initiated, which included both institutional and technical reforms. Provision for crop insurance against drought, flood, cyclone, fire and disease, the establishment of Grameen banks, cooperative societies and banks for providing loan facilities to the farmers at lower rates of interest were some important steps in this direction. Kissan Credit Card (KCC), Personal Accident Insurance Scheme (PAIS) are some other schemes introduced by the Government of India for the benefit of the farmers. Moreover, special weather bulletins and agricultural programmes for farmers were introduced on the radio and television. The government also announces minimum support price, remunerative and procurement prices for important crops to check the exploitation of farmers by speculators and middlemen.
","Organic farming is much in vogue today because it is practiced without factor made chemicals such as fertilisers and pesticides. Hence, it does not affect the environment in a negative manner. Indian farmers should diversify their cropping pattern from cereals to high-value crops. This will increase incomes and reduce environmental degradation simultaneously. Because fruits, medicinal herbs, flowers, vegetables, bio-diesel crops like jatropha and jojoba need much less irrigation than rice or sugarcane. India’s diverse climate can be harnessed to grow a wide range of high-value crops.

Why do you think that solar energy has a bright future in India? ,"Solar Energy has a bright future in India because we are a tropical country with enormous possibilities of tapping solar energy. Solar energy is fast becoming popular in rural and remote areas. India’s largest solar power plant is located at Madhapur, near Bhuj, where solar energy is used to sterilise milk cans. It is expected that use of solar energy will be able to minimise the dependence of rural households on firewood and dung cakes, which in turn will contribute to environmental conservation and adequate supply of manure in agriculture. Solar energy is a non-conventional source of energy which is also renewable. Use of solar energy will not only be good for the environment, but it will also reduce our dependence on oil and gas.","Solar energy has a bright future in India because

","•	India is blessed with plenty of solar energy because most parts of the country receives a bright monsoon period.",The climate of India is described as the ‘monsoon’ type. Monsoon refers to the seasonal reversal in the wind direction during a year. The monsoon type of climate is characterised by a distinct seasonal pattern. The weather conditions greatly change from one season to the other. These changes are particularly noticeable in the interior parts of the country. The coastal areas do not experience much variation in temperature though there is variation in rainfall pattern. 
How are integrated steel plants different from mini steel plants? What problems does the industry face? What recent developments have led to a rise in the production capacity? ," Integrated steel plants are large and handle everything in one complex - from putting together raw material to steel making, rolling and shaping. Mini steel plants are smaller, have electric furnaces, use steel scrap and sponge iron. They have rerollers that use steel ingots as well. They produce mild and alloy steel of given specifications.

The challenges faced by the steel industry are: 1. High cost and limited availability of coking coal 2. Lower productivity of labour 3. Irregular supply of energy 4. Poor infrastructure Recent developments such as liberalisation and foreign direct investment (FDI) have given a boost to the industry with the efforts of private entrepreneurs.","The Indian iron and steel industry consists of large integrated steel plants as well as mini steel mills. The difference between the two is that integrated steel plants put together the whole process from converting the iron ore to production and manufacturing of steel and finished and semi-finished products. On the other hand, mini steel plants use pig iron or leftovers from integrated steel plants to make alloys. This is why there is a need for integrated steel plants to be located near the mining sites of iron ore, coal and limestone otherwise the transportation cost is too high and mini steel plants have no such location restrictions.
Major problems faced by the iron and steel industry in India are—requirement of huge investment capital, lack of technology, low per capita labour productivity, the inefficiency of public sector units, low utilisation of potential, shortage of coal and irregular power supply. Despite these issues, India became the 2nd largest steel producer in the world in 2019 after China. This growth and expansion is a result of foreign direct investment and liberalisation and privatisation policies.","Differences between integrated steel plants and mini steel plants: Mini steel plants are smaller, have electric furnaces, use steel scrap and sponge iron.

From sorting of raw material to manufacturing of steel, everything is done in a chain in integrated steel plants. At present, there are ten major integrated steel plants in India.   (b) Mini Steel Plants These are smaller in size as compare to integrated steel plants. These usually have an electric arc furnace and use steel scrap and sponge iron as raw material. At present, there are more than 200 mini steel plants in India.   (c) Problem Faced by Industry Poor infrastructure. Low efficiency of the work force. Shortage of the availability of cooking coal.  Lack of energy supply.   (d) Recent Developments In recent years, the Policy of Liberalization and FDI (Foreign Direct Investment) have provided boost to iron and steel industry.

The seasonal alteration of the wind systems and the associated weather conditions provide a rhythmic cycle of seasons. Even the uncertainties of rain and uneven distribution are very much typical of the monsoons. The Indian landscape, it’s animal and plants life, its entire agricultural calendar and the life of the people, including their festivities, revolve around this phenomenon. Year after year, people of India from north to south and from east to west, eagerly await the arrival of the monsoon. These monsoon winds bind the whole country by providing water to set the agricultural activities in motion. The river valleys which carry this water also unite as a single river valley unit."
How do industries pollute the environment?,"Industries are responsible for four types of pollution: 1. Air 2. Water 3. Land 4. Noise Air pollution is caused by the presence of a high proportion of undesirable gases, such as sulphur dioxide and carbon monoxide and airborne particulate matter. Water pollution is caused by organic and inorganic industrial wastes and effluents discharged into water bodies. Paper, refineries and tanneries are the main culprits. Soil and water pollution are closely related. Dumping of waste makes the soil useless for agricultural activities. The pollutants then reach the groundwater through the soil and contaminate it. Noise pollution is caused by industrial machinery and construction activities.","Industries have increased pollution and degraded the environment. Industries create four types of pollution mainly air, water, land and noise. The smoke emitted by the industry pollutes the air and water immensely. Air pollution is caused by the presence of a higher proportion of undesirable gases such as carbon monoxide and sulphur oxide.
Source of water pollution are numerous. Most important is the industrial effluent that discharges into rivers. They are both organic and inorganic. They pollute the water. Unwanted loud noise is also pollution. It arises from industries and the different means of transport. Noise causes impairment to hear.","The various ways through which industries can cause pollution in the environment are:
- Air Pollution: It happens when the industries produce a high proportion of poisonous gases like carbon monoxide in the air. It can cause toxicity in the air and can affect humans, animals, and plants also. This can also lead to Acid Rain which has other effects. Industries that produce poisonous gasses are chemical industries, brick-making industries, mineral industries, etc.
- Water Pollution: Industries that dump organic and inorganic industrial wastes in the water cause water pollution. These can affect marine life and also the life of humans who use the water for different purposes. It can also affect the agriculture industry. Industries that cause water pollution are oil refineries, paper factories, sugar mills, and chemical industries.
- Thermal Pollution: This happens when the industries release hot water into rivers and ponds without cooling it. This affects aquatic life and humans also. The industries that cause thermal pollution are the ones that use water as a Cooling Agent in Power, Manufacturing, and Industrial Plants.

Industries have increased pollution and degraded the environment. There are four ways of causing pollution, i.e. air, water, land, and noise.
•	Water pollution: Water pollution is caused by the discharge of organic and inorganic industrial effluents into the water bodies with treating it. The main culprits in this regard are the paper, pulp, chemical, textile and dyeing industries, as well as petroleum refineries, tanneries, and electroplating industries, which discharge dyes, detergents, acids, salts and heavy metals such as lead and mercury into the river, as well as pesticides, fertilizers, synthetic chemicals with carbon, plastics and rubber. Dumping of pollutants, hazardous chemicals, and industrial effluents, such as packaging, render soil worthless. It also causes ground water pollution due to precipitation seepage.
•	Air pollution: The smoke released by factories severely pollutes air and water badly. Smoke is produced by paper mills; the combustion of fossil fuels in large and small companies is a major source of air pollution. One of the great causes of air pollution is the burning of fossil fuels in big and small factories.
•	Noise pollution: Noise pollution is caused by factory machinery, generators, and saws. Noise is produced by industrial and construction operations, as well as pneumatic and electric drills.
•	Thermal pollution: When hot water from industries and thermal plants is discharged into rivers and ponds before cooling, it causes thermal pollution.

Discuss the steps to be taken to minimise environmental degradation by industry? ,"The steps that can be taken to minimise environmental degradation by industries are: 1. Adopting the latest techniques and upgrading existing equipment to improve energy efficiency. 2. Providing green belts for nurturing ecological balance. 3. Particulate matter in the air can be reduced by fitting smokestacks to factories with electrostatic precipitators, fabric filters, scrubbers and inertial separators. 4. Using silencers for noise generating equipment. 5. Minimising water usage by reusing and recycling it in two or more successive stages. 6. Harvesting of rainwater to meet water requirements 7. Treating hot water and effluents before releasing them in rivers and ponds. Treatment of industrial effluents can be done in three phases: a. Primary treatment by mechanical means. This involves screening, grinding, flocculation and sedimentation. b. Secondary treatment by biological process c. Tertiary treatment by biological, chemical and physical processes.

To curb environmental degradation, four steps can be followed which are the 3Rs concept, reducing the usage of vehicles on road, creating awareness among citizens, and enforcing the laws.
3Rs refer to reduce, reuse and recycle. On a small scale, citizens should reduce the usage of air-conditioners as they release harmful gases. They release ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons which will result in reducing air pollution. All in all, they should reduce the consumption of contaminants and nonrenewable resources.

Second-hand consumption is looked down upon. However, this will not be the case forever as once something runs out, we shall never be able to get that resource back if it is non renewable in nature. If people start reusing specific things, environmental degradation will be greatly reduced. For example, they can use an empty can as a pencil stand.
We should also attempt to recycle whatever we can in order to derive maximum benefits with lowest exploitation.
We should also reduce the number of vehicles on the road as they cause both sound and air pollution. As much as possible, we should switch to cleaner fuels which don’t harm nature comparatively.
Several campaigns about saving the environment can be organized at a local, national or international level in order to spread awareness among people and prevent cases of carelessness. These also include cleanliness drives.
The legislature will be required to form stricter policies with harsher punishments to prevent violation of the bills they pass. Effective implementation and vigilant supervision also become extremely crucial in this context.","The steps to be taken to minimize environmental degradation by industry are:

The duration of the monsoon is between 100120 days from early June to mid-September. Around the time of its arrival, the normal rainfall increases suddenly and continues constantly for several days. This is known as the ‘burst’ of the monsoon and can be distinguished from the pre-monsoon showers. The monsoon arrives at the southern tip of the Indian peninsula generally by the first week of June. Subsequently, it proceeds into two – the Arabian Sea branch and the Bay of Bengal branch. The Arabian Sea branch reaches Mumbai about ten days later on approximately the 10th of June. This is a fairly rapid advance. "
Why are the means of transportation and communication called the lifelines of a nation and its economy?,"The means of transportation and communication are called the lifelines of a nation and its economy because they are the pre-requisites for fast development. Today, India is well-linked with the rest of the world despite its vast size, diversity and linguistic and socio-cultural plurality. Railways, airways, waterways, newspapers, radio, cinema, television and internet etc. have been contributing to its socioeconomic progress in many ways. Along with trade, these different means of transport and communication have enriched our life and added substantially to growing amenities and facilities for the comforts of life.","Today, we are living in the age of communication, using the telephone, television, films, and the Internet. Even books, magazines and newspapers are important means of communication. Various means of transport and communication have reduced distances, bringing the world closer. Modern life is so complex that one has to depend on others. The same is true of the countries as well. No country today can prosper without the co-operation and assistance of others. This requires the movement of goods and materials between countries. Trade provides us with our necessities and also adds to the amenities and comfort of our life. We may also notice that they are rightly called the lifelines of our national economy.","The means of transportation and communication are called the lifelines of a nation and its economy because they are the pre-requisites for the development of a country. They help to develop active links between different regions. This facilitates transportation of goods and services from production units to the demand locales. Fast-developing communication channels between different countries of the world has given rise to the Globalisation. Today, India is well-linked with the rest of the world which has been possible only due to transport and communication. Railways, airways, waterways, television, radio, newspapers, internet, etc., have contributed vastly to the socio-economic progress of our country. They have also added substantially to growing amenities and facilities improving our lifestyles.","The means of transportation and communication are called the lifelines of a nation and economy. This is because they are the backbone of the economy and hallmark of development of a nation. Transportation and communication help in the expansion of trade and boost the economy. The development of transportation and communication has given rise to globalisation.
The fast growth in communications and transportations has led to the improvement of lifestyles of the people of every nation. The railways, waterways, airways, newspaper, radio, internet has brought the world at our doorstep and contributed towards social and economic development. In an agricultural country like India, improved means of transport and communication has helped the national economy. Farmers are able to transport their goods within a short period of time and earn more capital. India is also well connected with the entire world due to its improved airways and railways.
The local trade has reached international levels which is excellent for the economic growth of every nation. Transportation allows the movement of working people from one place to another in a short time. Land transports like buses and trains can carry a large number of people and are also pocket friendly. Transport allows the movement of goods from their supply to demand locations. With the invention of modern transports, international trade has increased a lot. Exchange of information and knowledge through modern means of communication has made people more aware.They exchange goods and commodities at a much faster pace for example: online delivery service.","Lifelines of a human being are his veins. They carry blood in all the parts the body and keep them hale and hearty.

Likewise means of transport and comunication bring all the regions of a country closer and develop them equally. Likewise, Means of transportation and communication are called lifelines of nation and its economy because   (a) An efficient and well developed system of transport is essential for the utilization of the natural resources.   (b) They are the very basis of industries and trade of country.    (c) Just as the arteries supply blood to different organs of the body, a well developed system of transport maintains the movement of persons and products from one region to another region of the country.   (d) Means of communication help in sending and receiving messages and play an important role in creasing awareness among the people at national level. These help in defending the independence and the national unity of a country.   (ii) International trade has undergone major changes during the last 15 years. Exchange of commodities and goods is being augmented and superseded by exchange of information and knowledge. India has emerged as a software giant at the international level and is earning a large amount of foreign exchange through the export of information technology products.  ","In this era of globalization, the damage caused to the environment is massive, and its adverse impacts on humans remain undeniable.
To curb environmental degradation, four steps can be followed which are the 3Rs concept, reducing the usage of vehicles on road, creating awareness among citizens, and enforcing the laws.
3Rs refer to reduce, reuse and recycle. On a small scale, citizens should reduce the usage of air-conditioners as they release harmful gases. They release ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons which will result in reducing air pollution. All in all, they should reduce the consumption of contaminants and nonrenewable resources.

Second-hand consumption is looked down upon. However, this will not be the case forever as once something runs out, we shall never be able to get that resource back if it is non renewable in nature. If people start reusing specific things, environmental degradation will be greatly reduced. For example, they can use an empty can as a pencil stand.
We should also attempt to recycle whatever we can in order to derive maximum benefits with lowest exploitation.
We should also reduce the number of vehicles on the road as they cause both sound and air pollution. As much as possible, we should switch to cleaner fuels which don’t harm nature comparatively.
Several campaigns about saving the environment can be organized at a local, national or international level in order to spread awareness among people and prevent cases of carelessness. These also include cleanliness drives.
The legislature will be required to form stricter policies with harsher punishments to prevent violation of the bills they pass. Effective implementation and vigilant supervision also become extremely crucial in this context.","The means of transportation and communication are called the lifelines of a nation and its economy because they are the pre-requisites for fast development.

The Family Welfare Programme has sought to promote responsible and planned parenthood on a voluntary basis. The National Population Policy (NDP) 2000 is a culmination of years of planned efforts. The NPP 2000 provides a policy framework for imparting free and compulsory school education up to 14 years of age, reducing the infant mortality rate to below 30 per 1000 live births, achieving universal immunisation of children against all vaccine-preventable diseases, promoting delayed marriage for girls, and making family welfare a people-centred programme."

The latitudinal and longitudinal extent of India is about 30° where the east-west extent is smaller than the north-south extent. There is a time lag of two hours from Gujarat to Arunachal Pradesh and as Arunachal Pradesh lies to the eastern side of India, therefore, the sun rises earlier here as compared to Gujarat. Also, the time along the Standard Meridian of India (82°30'E) passing through Mirzapur (in Uttar Pradesh) is taken as the standard time for the whole country. The latitudinal extent influences the duration of day and night, as one moves from south to north. Therefore, the watches show the same time in all the parts of the country."
