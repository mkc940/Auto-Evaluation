# Auto-Evaluation
There are questions and their answers for evaluation have been given for evaluation.
❖ There are two types of answers. Some answers were written by teachers/experts
and remaining answers were taken from the students for whom evaluation has to be
done.
❖ Each answer given by students for a particular question will be compared/evaluated
with teacher’s answers and will be assigned some marks on the basis of
performance (similarity score). The best answer will be selected for evaluation and
hence best score will be awarded to students.
❖ I have to find a matching percentage of students’ answers compared to sample
answers and simultaneously give marks to students on their performances.
